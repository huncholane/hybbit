  introParagraphs: [
    "Simple Analytics lives up to its name: it's a privacy-focused analytics tool that keeps things minimal. It offers a clean dashboard, cookie-free tracking, and EU-based data storage. But its simplicity means no session replay, no funnel analysis, no user journeys, and only country-level geolocation. It's also entirely closed-source with no self-hosting option.",
    "Hygo matches Simple Analytics on privacy (cookie-free, no personal data collection, EU data storage) but adds the advanced features growing teams actually need. Session replay lets you watch how users interact with your site. Funnel analysis shows where visitors drop off in your conversion flow. User journey visualization reveals the paths people take through your content. And city-level geolocation gives you much more granular insights into where your audience is.",
    "The business model difference matters too. Hygo is fully open source under AGPL v3, so you can self-host it for free and verify exactly how your data is handled. Simple Analytics is proprietary, so you're locked into their cloud service with no alternative. If you want privacy-first analytics with the depth to actually improve your product and the transparency of open source, Hygo is the stronger choice.",

      question: "Is Hygo open source while Simple Analytics is not?",
      answer: "Yes. Hygo is fully open source under the AGPL v3 license, so you can inspect the code and self-host it. Simple Analytics is proprietary and closed-source with no self-hosting option.",

    {
      question: "What features does Hygo have that Simple Analytics doesn't?",
      answer: "Hygo includes session replay, funnel analysis, user journey visualization (Sankey diagrams), Web Vitals monitoring, error tracking, user profiles, city-level geolocation, and organization support. Simple Analytics focuses on simpler metrics with an AI assistant.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does geolocation differ between the two?",
      answer: "Hygo provides city-level geolocation data, giving you more granular insights into where your visitors are. Simple Analytics only offers country-level data, which limits your ability to understand regional traffic patterns.",

    {
      question: "Are both equally private?",
      answer: "Both are privacy-first and cookie-free with EU data storage. Hygo adds a daily rotating salt option for extra privacy, ensuring visitor IDs can't be tracked across days. Both are GDPR compliant without requiring consent banners.",

      question: "Can I switch from Simple Analytics to Hygo easily?",
      answer: "Yes. Add Hygo's tracking script to your site and data collection begins immediately. You can run both tools in parallel during the transition. Setup takes less than 5 minutes.",
